    photocapacitance measurements to study volatile functionality in YMnO3 coated MIS Diodes
    YMnO3 thin films are proposed as a new candidate for non-volatile ferroelectric memory devices. 
    Hexagonal YMnO3 shows a unique improper ferroelectricity induced by structural trimerization. 
    Extensive research on this system is primarily due to its candidacy for ferroelectric memory as well as the intriguing coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism..
